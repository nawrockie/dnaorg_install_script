#
# This file explains how to install the dnaorg_build.pl,
# dnaorg_classify.pl and dnaorg_annotate.pl scripts for viral genome
# annotation, along with dependencies of those three scripts.
# 
# This directory contains one other file: install.sh. 
#
# Copy install.sh into the directory you want to install the software.
# I recommend creating a new directory and copying install.sh to that
# directory.
#
# By default install.sh will install the following:
# 
# - perl scripts: dnaorg_build.pl dnaorg_classify.pl dnaorg_annotate.pl
#
# - perl modules: epn-options and Bio-Easel
#
# - secondary perl scripts: esl-epn-translate.pl and esl-fetch-cds.pl
#   which are called by dnaorg_annotate.pl, dnaorg_classify.pl and
#   dnaorg_build.pl.
#
# - other software packages: infernal and hmmer 3.1b2
#   The version of infernal is actually a development version 
#   post-version 1.1.2 but not a stable release.
# 
# install.sh will also output instructions on how to add several
# environment variable value to your .bashrc of .cshrc file, a
# necessary step you need to complete before you can run
# the dnaorg* perl scripts.
#
# The dnaorg* scripts need the edirect tools (efetch, xtract etc.) and
# idfetch to be installed in order to work. These are also installed
# in system-wide NCBI directories.
#
# -----------------------------------------------
# An example of running install.sh in a new directory called dnaorg-dir in
# your home directory would be:
#
# 'mkdir ~/dnaorg-dir'
# 'cp install.sh ~/dnaorg-dir'
# 'cd ~/dnaorg-dir'
# 'source ./install.sh'
#
