#
# This file explains how to install the dnaorg_build.pl and
# dnaorg_annotate.pl scripts for viral genome annotation, along with
# dependencies of those two scripts.
# 
# This directory contains one other file: install.sh. 
#
# Copy install.sh into the directory you want to install the software.
# I recommend creating a new directory and copying install.sh to that
# directory.
#
# By default install.sh will install the following:
# 
# - perl scripts: dnaorg_build.pl dnaorg_annotate.pl
#
# - perl modules: epn-options and Bio-Easel
#
# - secondary perl scripts: esl-epn-translate.pl and esl-fetch-cds.pl
#   which are called by dnaorg_annotate.pl and dnaorg_build.pl.
#
# - other software packages: infernal v1.1.2 and hmmer 3.1b2
#
# install.sh will also output instructions on how to add the DNAORGDIR
# environment variable value to your .bashrc of .cshrc file, a
# necessary step you need to complete before you can run
# dnaorg_annotate.pl or dnaorg_build.pl.
#
# dnaorg_build.pl and dnaorg_annotate.pl need the edirect tools
# (efetch, xtract etc.) and idfetch to be installed in order to
# work. These are also installed in system-wide NCBI directories.
#
# -----------------------------------------------
# An example of running install.sh in a new directory called dnaorg-dir in
# your home directory would be:
#
# 'mkdir ~/dnaorg-dir'
# 'cp install.sh ~/dnaorg-dir'
# 'cd ~/dnaorg-dir'
# 'source ./install.sh'
#
